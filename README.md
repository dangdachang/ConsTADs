# ConsTADs
Topologically associating domains (TADs) have emerged as basic structural and functional units of genome organization, and have been determined by many computational methods from Hi-C contact maps. However, the TADs obtained by different methods vary greatly, which makes the accurate determination of TADs a challenging issue and hinders subsequent biological analyses about their organization and functions. This project is about comparing different TAD-calling methods, building the TAD separation landscape and finding the consensus TADs from results of multiple methods.
